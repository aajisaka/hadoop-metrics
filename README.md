hadoop-metrics
==============

Our goal is to document all of the default metrics of Apache Hadoop.

Document is [here](https://github.com/aajisaka/hadoop-metrics/wiki). (This document includes the metrics of 1.x Hadoop)

I created a patch in [HADOOP-6350](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6350) and this has been merged.

The latest document is available in [my github.io repository](http://aajisaka.github.io/hadoop-project/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/Metrics.html).
